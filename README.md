<h1>Coding QUIZ!</h1>

This week we've been challenged to create a coding quiz, that will allow users to have a fun, interactive quiz that will educate them on the different languages of coding. I started this quiz with a very rough timeline, the setting of the homework assignment was the day before I went on a family holiday to the GoldCoast, so this assignment was a little rushed, and admittedly the questions are a bit boring. Never the less, I started with the HTML, creating a grid layout with a container which would hold my interactive questions, and set up 4 buttons to use with my JavaScript. 

 

I then added a touch of css to stop the page from looking too boring, and set where I wanted my high scores and timer to be. I managed to get them to stick where I wanted them, and then set myself the first task, of making a starting button that would link to the starting of my timer. I looked up a lot of code and used the examples from in class during the week, to create some JavaScript code to get my timer to start. I then set it to 60 and left it, and was going to add functionality to it later, but I ran out of time...

Next, I created my questions, set them into objects within arrays, and set up a true or false characteristic to them. I then started my quiz, made a function for start game to do more then set off a timer, and began the long road of fault finding and googling. I began setting up with logic, what would happen next after everything was clicked and saved into variables. I added event listeners along the way, and asked them to log a basic result to check if they were working. I watched a lot of YouTube videos explaining how they would go about setting the next question, and found some logic and ideas that I had never come across, but implementing and refactoring them to fit my code really helped me get the questions to clean and then set a new one. 

 

With a holiday set on a very unfortunate week to get the longest and hardest assignment, I'm happy with how far I got, but was saddened by the fact I couldnâ€™t finish it properly, get it to work how it was meant to. I began to really enjoy the assignment, and started to learn the power of event listeners and JavaScript itself. Being able to append text/buttons in, and hide/show content when items are clicked is a really useful tool, and this assignment really taught me how useful they can be!
